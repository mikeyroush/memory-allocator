# memory-allocator

This project implements a buddy-system memory manager that allocates memory in blocks with sizes that are power-of-two multiples of a basic block size. you can specify the basic block size and total block size with `-b ` and `-s` flags respectively.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

Download the zip then link the files in the command line via the makefile and run the executable

Navigate to the correct directory and utilize the makefile

```console
foo@bar:~$ cd /path/to/directory/here
foo@bar:~$ make all
```

This will have created a few .o files and an executable. To run it, do as follows...

```console
foo@bar:~$ ./memtest -b 128 -s 2048
```
